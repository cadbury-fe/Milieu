## Synopsis
Newlyweds Marcel and Madeline elope north to the border between Setanta (a country) and Crucible (a country).
Claude and Claudia (twins) chase after people who kidnapped their mother.

## Mechanics
- Units have the ability to act again after defeating an enemy.
- Each unit has a skill unique to them and sometimes a unique weapon or item.
- Enemy units also have skills, based on their class.
- The player can rewind their actions to a prior position during gameplay, and this is an unlimited action.
- If defeated in battle, player units disappear but return next chapter.
- Aside from the above, the game plays like a Fire Emblem game for the GameBoyAdvance
